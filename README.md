# SafeDuck
Safeduck is an open source desktop app written in c# that encrypts/decrypts text into/from images.

SafeDuck (formerly SafeID) was supposed to be an iOS app, however, I can not pay for the developer license, which is why I took the idea and created SafeDuck. The main idea is to make sharing pictures little bit more secure by encrypting a custom message into the pictures.
